//		Q38. What is Polymorphism and encapsulation?
//		An ability of an object to take many forms is called polymorphism. for eg. real world example of frog can be a terrestrial and also aquatic animal since it can 
//		inherits both behaviors its a polymorphic object.
//		whenever an object pass inheritance test it will become polymorphic since it can behave as child class and also as aparent class.
//		every object extends to object class so all can be polymorphism.
//		
//		Polymorphism two types
//		1. Static Polymorphism(method overloading)
//		2. Dynamic Polymorphism.
		
		
//		Encapsulation:
//		-------------
//		Encapsulation is the process of wrapping/binding data with methods
//		Encapsulation is a way of achieve data hiding
