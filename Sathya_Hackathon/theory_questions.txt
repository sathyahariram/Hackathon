Q37. What is JVM and explain me the Java memory allocation
----------------------------------------------------------
JVM-Java Virtual Mechine
JVM runs the java bytecodes, we get this bytecodes by compiling the java files into class files.
class files contain  the bytecodes understood by the JVM.

Java memory allocation
Java memory allocation is a process of allocating or assigning memory to various java objects.

Q41. What is the difference between String and String buffer?
------------------------------------------------------------
String is immutable while string buffer is mutable that means we can modify a stringbuffer object once created it 
without creating any new object, where in string it is not possible.

Q42. What is the difference between array and array list?
------------------------------------------------------------
Array is a fixed length data structure, Arraylist is a variable length data structure, it can be resized itsrelf when
needed. 
Arrays can hold only homogeneous data type elements, where arraylist can hold homogeneous and hetrogeneous data elements
Array use for loop to iterate an array, where in arraylist we can use iterater, for loop and for each to iterate the data.

Q43. What is the difference between hash map and Hash table?
------------------------------------------------------------
Hash map and hashtable both are data structures that map keys to values, where hashmap allows one null key and multible values whereas
hashtable doesnot allow any null key or value. Hashmap is generally preffered over hashtable if thread synchronization is not needed since it 
is faster.

Q44. What is a vector in Java?
-------------------------------

Q45. What is set in java?
--------------------------
Set is an interface which is an unordered collection where duplicate values cannot be stored.
set is implemented by *Hashset(unordered), *LinkedHashset, *Treeset(ordered form)
Set has various methods to implement.

Q46. What is an abstract class?
-------------------------------
Abstract class is which may contain implemented and not implemented methods, Abstract class cannot
be instantiated(creating object not possible), but they can be used in subclasses.

Q47. What is an interface?
--------------------------
Interface is which is having methods but no body or no implementation, that means which is having abstract methods.
keyword for the class is inerface. i think we can this as blueprint of a class is called interface.
An interface specifies the behaviour of a class by providing an abstractive type. Interface cannot be instantiated 
that is objects cannot be created.

Q48.  Why Java is Platform independent?
-----------------------------------------
Java uses JVM(Java Virtual Machine) which converts the code into bytecodes so that we can run the code in any platform.
JDK- Java Development Kit which is having JVM and JRE so it creates the environment to execute and takes care of the
difference between bytecodes for different platforms, so java is called platform independent.

Q49. What are access modifiers? Give me an example?
----------------------------------------------------
Acces modifiers are used to protect the data and give access that who can use and access the data.

Public: can be accessed anywhere.
Private: only within same class
Protected: can be accessed in same class or in same package differentt class or inhereted class of another package.cannotbe used in external package and class.
Default:within same class or same package different class can be accessed, cannotbe used in external package and class, and inherited class different package.

Q50. What are java exceptions? Give me an example
---------------------------------------------------------
when ever we try to do a incorrect operation exceptions will be trowed,




Q51. What is the difference between throws and throwable?
---------------------------------------------------------




Q52. What is the difference between Error and exception?
-------------------------------------------------------------



Q53. What is the difference between Error, throwable and exception?
--------------------------------------------------------------------




Q54. What are collection APIs, give me an example
--------------------------------------------------




Q55. What is the difference between final and finally?
---------------------------------------------------------
final is keyword and can be used for variables(cannot reassign the value), methods(cannot be overridden), class(cannot inherited)
Finally is block of code. By using try catch when there is a an exception throwing error can be catched and printed by 
executing the comple program. finally block will execute when there is no exception also.

Q56. Will java supports multiple inheritance?
----------------------------------------------
Yes, Java supports multiple inheritance.


Q57.  What are the different types of interface?
-------------------------------------------------
Under the collection Interface we have list, set and queue Interfaces.
List- Arraylist, Linked list, Vector
Set-Hashset, Linked Hashset
Queue-priority queue

Map Interface- Hashmap, Linked Hashmap.

Q58. What are wrapper class? Give me an example
-------------------------------------------------
converting primitive data type into object and converting the object into corresponding primitive data type


eg:
int a=123;
Integer a1= new Integer(a);
or 
Integer a1= new Integer(50);

eg:
Integer a1= new Integer(50);
int a=a1.intvalue();

Q59. What is boxing and unboxing in Java? Explain with an example
------------------------------------------------------------------
boxing 
converting primitive data type into object

eg:
int a=123;
Integer a1= new Integer(a);
or 
Integer a1= new Integer(50);

unboxing
converting the object into corresponding primitive data type is unboxing.

eg:
Integer a1= new Integer(50);
int a=a1.intvalue();

Q60. Explain for each loop
------------------------------
For each loop is used to get the data one by one from a collection of data
it starts with first item in the array and loop through continue till the last item.



Q61. What are iterators, explain with an example
--------------------------------------------------
The iterators are used for running the loop



Q 63. What is multithreading, serialization and Generics in Java
-----------------------------------------------------------------
